- BOOL isCircular (possible to navigate from last --> first and first --> last)
- BOOL shouldDownScale (whether or not to scale down during animation)
- animate shadow on from and to sides
- smoothen animation if cancelling (right now it jumps back to original state)
- handoff animation when user drags --> lets go (right now it doesn't take velocity into account)
